# Data Gaps

Using missing data theory to deal with data gaps in biodiversity data. Code underlying the plots in Figure 5 of http://doi.org/10.1111/brv.13127

Scripts: 
- sim_functions.R - this contains a bunch of functions to generate some data, add different types of missing data as well as different methods for dealing with the gaps.
- sim_solutions.R - this calls sim_functions.R, runs some simulations and then plots the outputs to generate Fig. 5
